                            in_tail actually does a bit more than tail -F itself. When rotating a file, some data may still need to be written to the old file as opposed to the new one.
                            in_tail takes care of this by keeping a reference to the old file (even after it has been rotated) for some time before transitioning completely to the new file.
                            This helps prevent data designated for the old file from getting lost. By default, this time interval is 5 seconds.
                            The rotate_wait parameter accepts a single integer representing the number of seconds you want this time interval to be.

                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.

                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                      description: |-
                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.


                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.


                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.


                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the

                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                  into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                  comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.

                                  may change the order over time.

                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                        completed.

                              to container and the other way around.
                              When not set, MountPropagationNone is used.
                              This field is beta in 1.10.
                              When RecursiveReadOnly is set to IfPossible or to Enabled, MountPropagation must be None or unspecified
                              (which defaults to None).

                              RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                              recursively.


                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.


                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                              recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                              recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                              field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                              supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                              an error will be generated to indicate the reason.


                              If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                              None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).


                              If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                  ephemeral:
                    description: |-
                      ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                      The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                      and deleted when the pod is removed.


                      Use this if:
                      a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                      b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                         tracking are needed,
                      c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                      d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                         a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                         information on the connection between this volume type
                         and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                      Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                      APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                      of an individual pod.


                      Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                      be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                      more information.


                      A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                      persistent volumes at the same time.
                    properties:
                      volumeClaimTemplate:

                          Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                          The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                          owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.
                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                may change the order over time.

                    ephemeral:
                      description: |-
                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.


                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.


                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.


                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                        volumeClaimTemplate:

                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same

                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            in_tail actually does a bit more than tail -F itself. When rotating a file, some data may still need to be written to the old file as opposed to the new one.
                            in_tail takes care of this by keeping a reference to the old file (even after it has been rotated) for some time before transitioning completely to the new file.
                            This helps prevent data designated for the old file from getting lost. By default, this time interval is 5 seconds.
                            The rotate_wait parameter accepts a single integer representing the number of seconds you want this time interval to be.

                    description: |-
                      ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                      The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                      and deleted when the pod is removed.


                      Use this if:
                      a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                      b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                         tracking are needed,
                      c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                      d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                         a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                         information on the connection between this volume type
                         and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                      Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                      APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                      of an individual pod.


                      Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                      be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                      more information.


                      A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                      persistent volumes at the same time.
                    properties:
                      volumeClaimTemplate:
                        description: |-
                          Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                          The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                          owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                          pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                          `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                          entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                          is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                          will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                          volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                          the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                          meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                          owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                          this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                          manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.
                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                              specified.
                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                              in any namespaces.
                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                            (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                    ephemeral:
                      description: |-
                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.


                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.


                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.


                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.
                      properties:
                        volumeClaimTemplate:
                          description: |-
                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.


                            This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes
                            to the PVC after it has been created.

                                    it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.

                                    dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                    volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                    the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                    provisioner.
                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    will be applied to the claim but it's not allowed to reset this field to empty string once it is set.
                                    If unspecified and the PersistentVolumeClaim is unbound, the default VolumeAttributesClass
                                    will be set by the persistentvolume controller if it exists.
                                    If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                    set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                                    exists.

                            Kubernetes name scoping to be mirrored within StorageOS for tighter integration.
                            Set VolumeName to any name to override the default behaviour.
                            Set to "default" if you are not using namespaces within StorageOS.
                            Namespaces that do not pre-exist within StorageOS will be created.

                            in_tail actually does a bit more than tail -F itself. When rotating a file, some data may still need to be written to the old file as opposed to the new one.
                            in_tail takes care of this by keeping a reference to the old file (even after it has been rotated) for some time before transitioning completely to the new file.
                            This helps prevent data designated for the old file from getting lost. By default, this time interval is 5 seconds.
                            The rotate_wait parameter accepts a single integer representing the number of seconds you want this time interval to be.
