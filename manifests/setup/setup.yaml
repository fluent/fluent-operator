                          API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed
                          if the type of the specified object matches some installed

                          are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                          * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects,
                          DataSourceRef   allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                          objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                          them), DataSourceRef   preserves all values, and generates
                          an error if a disallowed value is   specified. (Beta) Using
                          this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                          to be enabled.'

                            is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC
                            will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the
                            PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume
                            name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry.
                            Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated
                            name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long). \n
                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the
                            pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC
                            is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated
                            with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists.

                                    between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While
                                    DataSource only allows two specific types of objects,
                                    DataSourceRef   allows any non-core object, as
                                    well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While
                                    DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), DataSourceRef   preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.

                                    succeed if the type of the specified object matches
                                    some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner.
                                    This field will replace the functionality of the
                                    DataSource field and as such if both fields are
                                    non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                    backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource
                                    and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                    automatically if one of them is empty and the
                                    other is non-empty. There are two important differences
                                    between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While
                                    DataSource only allows two specific types of objects,
                                    DataSourceRef   allows any non-core object, as
                                    well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While
                                    DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), DataSourceRef   preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
