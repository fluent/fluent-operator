# Contributing to Fluent Operator

Firstly, thanks for your interest in contributing! I hope that this will be a pleasant first experience for you, and that you will return to continue contributing.

### How to contribute?

Most of the contributions that we receive are code contributions, but you can also contribute to the documentation or simply report solid bugs for us to fix.

For new contributors, please take a look at issues with a tag called [Good first issue](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [Help wanted](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

## Found a bug?

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-operator/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-operator/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

Note: Before report the issue, check latest version first. Sometimes users report fixed bug with older version.
