# OpenSearch

The opensearch output plugin, allows to ingest your records into an [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) database. The following instructions assumes that you have a fully operational OpenSearch service running in your environment.


| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Scheme                          |

| host               | IP address or hostname of the target OpenSearch instance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | string                          |

| path               | OpenSearch accepts new data on HTTP query path "/_bulk". But it is also possible to serve OpenSearch behind a reverse proxy on a subpath. This option defines such path on the fluent-bit side. It simply adds a path prefix in the indexing HTTP POST URI.                                                                                                                               | string                          |
| bufferSize         | Specify the buffer size used to read the response from the OpenSearch HTTP service. This option is useful for debugging purposes where is required to read full responses, note that response size grows depending of the number of records inserted. To set an unlimited amount of memory set this value to False, otherwise the value must be according to the Unit Size specification. | string                          |
| pipeline           | OpenSearch allows to setup filters called pipelines. This option allows to define which pipeline the database should use. For performance reasons is strongly suggested to do parsing and filtering on Fluent Bit side, avoid pipelines.                                                                                                                                                  | string                          |

| tagKey             | When Include_Tag_Key is enabled, this property defines the key name for the tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | string                          |

This prevents duplicate records when retrying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | *bool                           |

| logstashPrefixKey  | When included: the value in the record that belongs to the key will be looked up and over-write the Logstash_Prefix for index generation. If the key/value is not found in the record then the Logstash_Prefix option will act as a fallback. Nested keys are not supported (if desired, you can use the nest filter plugin to remove nesting).                                           | string                          |

### writeOperation
The writeOperation can be any of:

| Operation        | Description                                                                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| create (default) | adds new data - if the data already exists (based on its id), the op is skipped.                   |
| index            | new data is added while existing data (based on its id) is replaced (reindexed).                   |
| update           | updates existing data (based on its id). If no data is found, the op is skipped.                   |
| upsert           | known as merge or insert if the data does not exist, updates if the data exists (based on its id). |
