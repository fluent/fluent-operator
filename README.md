# Fluent Operator

Fluent Operator provides great flexibility in building a logging layer based on Fluent Bit and Fluentd.

Once installed, the Fluent Operator provides the following features:

- **Fluent Bit Management**: Deploy and destroy Fluent Bit DaemonSet automatically.
- **Fluentd Management**: Deploy and destroy Fluentd StatefulSet automatically.
- **Custom Configuration**: Select input/filter/output plugins via labels.
- **Dynamic Reloading**: Update configuration without rebooting Fluent Bit and Fluentd pods.
- **Multi-tenant log isolation**: Fluentd supports multi-tenant log isolation through `label_router` plugin.
- **Pluggable deployment components**: Either Fluent Bit or Fluentd can be deployed separately.

## Overview

Although both Fluent Bit and Fluentd can collect, process(parse and filter) and then forward log to the final destinations, still they have strengths in different aspects.

Fluent Bit is a good choice as a logging agent because of its lightweight and efficiency, while Fluentd is more powerful to perform advanced processing on logs because of its rich plugins.

- Fluent Bit only mode: If you just need to collect logs and send logs to the final destinations, all you need is Fluent Bit.
- Fluent Bit + Fluentd mode: If you also need to perform some advanced processing on the logs collected or send to more sinks, then you also need Fluentd.
- Fluentd only mode: If you need to receive logs through networks like HTTP or Syslog and then process and send the log to the final sinks, you only need Fluentd.

Fluent Operator includes CRDs and controllers for both Fluent Bit and Fluentd which allows you to config your log processing pipelines in the 3 modes mentioned above as you wish.

Fluent Bit will be deployed as a DaemonSet while Fluentd will be deployed as a StatefulSet. The whole workflow could be described as below:

![Fluent-operator](docs/images/fluent-operator.svg)

### Fluent Bit

The following CRDs are defined for Fluent Bit:
- **`FluentBit`**: Defines the Fluent Bit DaemonSet and its configs. A custom Fluent Bit image `kubesphere/fluent-bit` is required to work with FluentBit Operator for dynamic configuration reloading.
- **`ClusterFluentBitConfig`**: Select cluster-level input/filter/output plugins and generates the final config into a Secret.
- **`FluentBitConfig`**: Selects namespace-level filter/output/parser and cluster-level parser plugins and generates final config into a Secret.
- **`ClusterInput`**: Defines cluster-level input config sections.
- **`Parser`**: Defines namespace-level parser config sections.
- **`ClusterParser`**: Defines cluster-level parser config sections.
- **`Filter`**: Defines namespace-level filter config sections.
- **`ClusterFilter`**: Defines cluster-level filter config sections.
- **`Output`**: Defines namespace-level output config sections.
- **`ClusterOutput`**: Defines cluster-level output config sections.

Each **`ClusterInput`**, **`ClusterParser`**, **`ClusterFilter`**, **`ClusterOutput`** represents a Fluent Bit config section, which are selected by **`ClusterFluentBitConfig`** via label selectors. Fluent Operator watches those objects, constructs the final config, and finally creates a Secret to store the config which will be mounted into the Fluent Bit DaemonSet. The entire workflow looks like below:

![Fluent Bit workflow](docs/images/fluent-bit-operator-workflow.svg)

To enable Fluent Bit to pick up and use the latest config whenever the Fluent Bit config changes, a wrapper called Fluent Bit watcher is added to restart the Fluent Bit process as soon as Fluent Bit config changes are detected. This way, the Fluent Bit pod needn't be restarted to reload the new config. The Fluent Bit config is reloaded in this way because there is no reloading interface in Fluent Bit itself. Please refer to this [known issue](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/issues/365) for more details.

![fluentbit-operator](docs/images/fluentbit-operator.svg)

### Fluentd

The following CRDs are defined for Fluentd:

- **`Fluentd`**: Defines the Fluentd Statefulset and its configs. A custom Fluentd image `kubesphere/fluentd` is required to work with Fluentd Operator for dynamic configuration reloading.
- **`FluentdConfig`**: Select cluster-level or namespace-level scope input/filter/output plugins and generates the final config into a Secret.
- **`ClusterFluentdConfig`**: Select cluster-level input/filter/output plugins and generates the final config into a Secret.
- **`Filter`**: Defines namespace-level filter config sections.
- **`ClusterFilter`**: Defines cluster-level filter config sections.
- **`Output`**: Defines namespace-level output config sections.
- **`ClusterOutput`**: Defines cluster-level output config sections.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

Kubernetes v1.16.13+ is necessary for running Fluent Operator.

### Install

#### Deploy Fluent Operator with YAML

Install the latest stable version

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-operator/release-2.5/manifests/setup/setup.yaml

# You can change the namespace in manifests/setup/kustomization.yaml in corresponding release branch 
# and then use command below to install to another namespace
# kubectl kustomize manifests/setup/ | kubectl apply -f -
```

Install the development version

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluentbit-operator/master/manifests/setup/setup.yaml

# You can change the namespace in manifests/setup/kustomization.yaml 
# and then use command below to install to another namespace
# kubectl kustomize manifests/setup/ | kubectl apply -f -
```

#### Deploy Fluent Operator with Helm

> Note: For the helm based install, Helm v3.2.1 or higher is needed.

The Fluent Bit section of the Fluent Operator supports different CRI `docker`, `containerd`,  and `CRI-O`. 
`containerd` and `CRI-O` use the `CRI Log` format which is different with `docker`, they requires additional parser to parse JSON application logs. You should set different `containerRuntime` depending on your container runtime.

The default runtime is docker, you can choose other runtimes as follows.

If your container runtime is `containerd` or  `cri-o`, you can set the `containerRuntime` parameter to `containerd` or `crio`. e.g.

```shell
helm install fluent-operator --create-namespace -n fluent charts/fluent-operator/  --set containerRuntime=containerd
```

Install through the online chart link:

```shell
helm install fluent-operator --create-namespace -n fluent https://github.com/fluent/fluent-operator/releases/download/< version >/fluent-operator.tgz
```

> Please replace < version > with a actual version like v1.0.0

Fluent Operator CRDs will be installed by default when running a helm install for the chart. But if the CRD already exists, it will be skipped with a warning. So make sure you install the CRDs by yourself if you upgrade your Fluent Operator version.

By default the installation with Helm create all the CRDs (fluent-bit and fluentd ones).
If you do not intent to use one of the two components, it is possible to skip its CRDs and also to not start the controllers for it in the operator.
To achieve that `operator.disableComponentControllers` and `(fluent-bit/fluentd).crdsEnable` parameters can be provided:

```shell
helm install fluent-operator --create-namespace -n fluent charts/fluent-operator/  --set operator.disableComponentControllers=fluent-bit,fluent-bit.crdsEnable=false
```

> Note: During the upgrade process, if a CRD was previously created using the create operation, an error will occur during the apply operation. Using apply here allows the CRD to be replaced and created in its entirety in a single operation.

To replace the CRDs pull the current helm chart:
```
wget https://github.com/fluent/fluent-operator/releases/download/<version>/fluent-operator.tgz
tar -xf fluent-operator.tgz
```

To update the CRDs, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl replace -f fluent-operator/crds
```

### Fluent Operator Walkthrough

For more info on various use cases of Fluent Operator, you can refer to [Fluent-Operator-Walkthrough](https://github.com/kubesphere-sigs/fluent-operator-walkthrough).

### Collect Kubernetes logs

This guide provisions a logging pipeline including the Fluent Bit DaemonSet and its log input/filter/output configurations to collect Kubernetes logs including container logs and kubelet logs.

![logging stack](docs/images/logging-stack.svg)

> Note that you need a running Elasticsearch v5+ cluster to receive log data before start. **Remember to adjust [output-elasticsearch.yaml](manifests/logging-stack/output-elasticsearch.yaml) to your own es setup**. Kafka and Fluentd outputs are optional and are turned off by default.

#### Deploy the Kubernetes logging stack with YAML

```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/logging-stack

# You can change the namespace in manifests/logging-stack/kustomization.yaml 
# and then use command below to install to another namespace
# kubectl kustomize manifests/logging-stack/ | kubectl apply -f -
```

#### Deploy the Kubernetes logging pipeline with Helm

You can also deploy the Kubernetes logging pipeline with Helm, just need to set the `Kubernetes` parameter to `true` (default):

```shell
helm upgrade fluent-operator --create-namespace -n fluent charts/fluent-operator/  --set containerRuntime=docker
```

If you want to deploy  `fluentd`, just need to set the `fluentd.enable` parameter to `true`:

```shell
helm upgrade fluent-operator --create-namespace -n fluent charts/fluent-operator/  --set containerRuntime=docker,fluentd.enable=true
```

Within a couple of minutes, you should observe an index available:

```shell
$ curl localhost:9200/_cat/indices
green open ks-logstash-log-2020.04.26 uwQuoO90TwyigqYRW7MDYQ 1 1  99937 0  31.2mb  31.2mb
```

Success!

### Collect audit logs

The Linux audit framework provides a CAPP-compliant (Controlled Access Protection Profile) auditing system that reliably collects information about any security-relevant (or non-security-relevant) event on a system. Refer to `manifests/logging-stack/auditd`, it supports a method for collecting audit logs from the Linux audit framework.

```shell
kubectl apply -f manifests/logging-stack/auditd

# You can change the namespace in manifests/logging-stack/auditd/kustomization.yaml 
# and then use command below to install to another namespace
# kubectl kustomize manifests/logging-stack/auditd/ | kubectl apply -f -
```

Within a couple of minutes, you should observe an index available:

```shell
$ curl localhost:9200/_cat/indices
green open ks-logstash-log-2021.04.06 QeI-k_LoQZ2h1z23F3XiHg  5 1 404879 0 298.4mb 149.2mb
```

### Fluentd 

Fluentd acts as a log forward layer that receives logs from Fluent Bit or other Apps through the network.

For more info on various use cases of Fluent Operator Fluentd CRDs, you can refer to [Fluent-Operator-Walkthrough](https://github.com/kubesphere-sigs/fluent-operator-walkthrough#fluent-bit--fluentd-mode).
